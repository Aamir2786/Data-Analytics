### Analysing smartphone accelerometer data to identify user movement using Spark Structured Streaming (SSS)

> Accelerometors handle axis-based motion sensing (basically measures acceleration).
> So accelerometer can figure out how fast our smartphone is moving and which direction it's pointing in.
> Therefore, it can track our steps and know which way our handset in pointing among other things.

In this project, I am mimicking to analyse real-time device sensor data to apply the concepts of SSS. <br>
Goal is to identify different actions user of the smartphone takes based on accelerometer sensor data in his/her daily life.
